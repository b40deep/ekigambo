"The Abolition of Man," written by the English philosopher Edward Said Ignatius Craig Coward (1926â€“2017) and published in 1951, is considered a seminal work in the Western philosophical tradition. The book explores the theme of man as a cultural construct, examining whether and in what ways human beings can be considered autonomous and self-governing beings, or if they are fundamentally beholden to external determinants such as race, nation, or religion.
The central argument of "The Abolition of Man" is that modern Western societies, driven by Enlightenment ideals and the pursuit of progress, have progressively undermined the very foundations of human autonomy and self-determination. This process, which Coward refers to as "the gradual abolition of man," occurs through various interconnected factors:
1. Scientific Rationalism: Coward argues that the rise of scientific rationalism and the emphasis on reason and rationality in human society has led to an erosion of human autonomy. By emphasizing the role of logic and empirical evidence, individuals increasingly become subject to the dictates of science, researchers, and experts rather than possessing the ability to make their own decisions.
2. The Dialectical Worldview: The philosophical construct of dialectics, which posits the existence of opposing forces or ideas that are continuously in a state of synthesis, also contributes to the abolition of man. By emphasizing the inherent conflict and synthesis between opposing forces, dialectical thinking discourages individuals from acting on their own beliefs and desires, as they may be seen as irrational or illogical in the context of tl or illogical in the context of the dialectic's syntheses.
3. Technological Progress: The rapid advancements in technology over the 19th and 20th centuries have further eroded human autonomy. From the growth of bureaucracy in modern societies to the proliferation of mass media, technology has facilitated a degree of control over individuals, often by entities that are not inherently human (e.g., corporations).
4. The Uniformity of Language: Coward also examines the role of language in shaping human understanding and decision-making. By emphasizing the importance of linguistic norms and social conventions, he argues that language can be used to manipulate and control people, hindering their ability to think critically and act autonomously.
Coward presents "The Abolition of Man" as a critique of the Enlightenment project, which sought to elevate human reason and rationality to promote progress and social improvement. He contends that, by prioritizing scientific rationalism, dialectical thinking, and technological innovation, Western societies have lost sight of the fundamental importance of individual autonomy and self-determination. The book urges readers to reconsider the value of human autonomy and to question the implications of the gradual erosion of this fundamental aspect of human existence.
"The Abolition of Man" has been influential both in academic and political contexts and has been the subject of numerous critiques and reinterpretations. Still, its original argument and focus on the eroding autonomy of human beings remain central to its legacy and continuing relevance in discussions about individual freedom, social justice, and political philosophy.

In the Old Testament, prophecies and revelations foretell the impending arrival of the Messiah, 
who is central to the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, 
ensuring salvation and establishing God's eternal plan for humanity.

The Old Testament highlights the Messiah's coming through various prophecies, such as the line of Nathan the prophet, 
the virgin birth of Bethlehem, and the restoration of Israel under David's leadership. 
The Messiah's role as a divine ruler and sacrifice for sins is emphasized, 
with passages like Isaiah 9:6 and Psalm 40:10-11 serving as key references.

Amidst the British hills and urban scene,
Ugandan roots, yet a heart set free.
Longing for home, memories to reclaim,
Fondly recalling the warmth that sets thee free.

In a land of change, new beginnings,
Amidst hustle and bustle of urban life.
Thinking of Mama, Nyamizu, and kachumbari delight,
And how they bring comfort amidst strife.

From the bright sun of Uganda to the rainy clouds of a new land,
The memories flood back, with every beat of the heart.
Familiar sounds of laughter and joy,
Amidst a distance that's hard to forget.

So as the nights grow cold, and the days grow long,
Ugandan soul yearns to feel the embrace of home.
Wishing for the warmth of the African sky,
And the sweet symphony of a chorus of song.

A Ugandan, with dreams afar,
Moves to the UK, to a new star.
Missing home, dearly and true,
Longing for the sights and sounds anew.

Leaving behind the warmth and love,
Faces and voices, a heart tugged.
Farewell, dear ones, until we meet,
The memories we've shared, so sweet.
